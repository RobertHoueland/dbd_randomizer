Thank you to [Tricky](https://dbd.tricky.lol/api) for providing the DBD API

A python GUI that lets you generate a random loadout for either survivor or killer. WIP.

# DON'T DELETE THE FILE THAT GETS GENERATED

This "dbd_randomizer_cache.sqlite" file stores all the survivor/killer/perks, etc. information from the API. If you delete it, the program will have to download all the information again, which is slow and the website will temporarily block you if you do this too often.
